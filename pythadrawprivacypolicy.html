            <h1>PYTHA DRAW - Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Pytha Draw (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects the information associated with your use of the app. By using Pytha Draw, you agree to the practices described below.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="support-section">
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Information you provide</h3>
            <p>Pytha Draw does not collect personal data such as your real name, email address, phone number, or precise location. The only information you provide is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a username (pseudo) used to identify you in the game, leaderboards, and leagues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No other personal information is required to use the app.</p>

            <h3>1.2 Gameplay data</h3>
            <p>We store gameplay-related data needed for the functioning of the app, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>scores and performance statistics;</li>
                <li>radars and progress metrics;</li>
                <li>levels completed;</li>
                <li>league participation and rankings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data cannot identify you personally and is linked only to your pseudo.</p>

            <h3>1.3 Automatic technical data</h3>
            <p>To ensure stability and improve the app, we may collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>device model;</li>
                <li>anonymous crash logs;</li>
                <li>diagnostics and performance data;</li>
                <li>basic usage analytics (non-identifiable).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not collect precise location or sensitive data.</p>

            <h3>1.4 Rewarded ads (AdMob / Google)</h3>
            <p>Pytha Draw offers rewarded ads: you can watch an ad to receive an in-game reward (for example, gain one life). To serve these ads, we use Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads SDK).</p>
            <p>In this context, Google may process certain technical and ad-related usage data, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>technical information about the device and the app;</li>
                <li>IP address (typically used for security, fraud prevention, and approximate location);</li>
                <li>ad events (impressions, interactions, performance);</li>
                <li>diagnostics data related to the ad SDK.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These activities are performed by Google in accordance with Google’s own privacy policies and terms.</p>

            <h3>1.5 Third-party services</h3>
            <p>We use trusted services to operate the app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supabase (database and authentication);</li>
                <li>Render (backend hosting);</li>
                <li>Google AdMob (rewarded ads delivery).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These services handle only the minimal data required for the app to function and/or to deliver ads.</p>
