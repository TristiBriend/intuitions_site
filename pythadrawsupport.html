            <h1>Welcome to the Pytha Draw Support Page</h1>
            <p>Pytha Draw is an educational mobile game designed to help you build mathematical intuition by drawing functions directly on a graph.</p>
            <p>By playing, you progressively master polynomials (degree 1, 2, and 3), along with related concepts such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>derivatives</li>
                <li>canonical forms</li>
                <li>roots</li>
                <li>variations</li>
                <li>limits</li>
                <li>comparative growth</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you need guidance or encounter an issue, you are in the right place.</p>

            <h2>Playing Modes</h2>
            <p>Pytha Draw includes several game modes, each training a specific mathematical skill.</p>

            <h3>Classic Mode</h3>
            <p>Draw the function directly without visual aids. Focus on precision or speed, and discover techniques step by step in Learn mode.</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> learning curve-reading and improving drawing accuracy.</p>

            <h3>Derivative Mode</h3>
            <p>Draw the function using only its derivative. Each level reveals essential information about how the original function behaves.</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> understanding variations and extrema.</p>

            <h3>Canonical Mode</h3>
            <p>Transform the equation into a canonical form where the graph becomes directly readable. This makes the curve easier to interpret and draw accurately.</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> factorisation, structure recognition, rapid computations.</p>

            <h3>Addition Mode</h3>
            <p>Break the expression apart to draw more accurately. Mentally add the missing right part of the equation to reconstruct the perfect curve.</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> decomposition, mental manipulation, and precise plotting.</p>

            <h3>Guess Mode</h3>
            <p>The game is reversed. Reconstruct the equation from the drawing, only one attempt to get it right.</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> linking visual shape to algebraic form.</p>

            <h2>Learn Mode and Tutorials</h2>
            <p>Learn Mode is the guided learning path in Pytha Draw. It introduces concepts progressively through short interactive steps, combining:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>clear explanations (what to look for on the graph),</li>
                <li>guided practice (draw with purpose, not by guessing),</li>
                <li>quick checks (mini-questions when needed),</li>
                <li>and immediate feedback (so you learn from each attempt).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Learn Mode helps you improve</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>reading and drawing polynomial curves (degree 1, 2, 3),</li>
                <li>connecting algebra ↔ graph,</li>
                <li>recognizing key features (slope, roots, vertex, extrema),</li>
                <li>and applying techniques used in the other game modes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to access Learn Mode</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the app and go to Learn.</li>
                <li>Select a tutorial category (Linear, Quadratic, etc.).</li>
                <li>Follow the steps in order.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Tips if a tutorial feels difficult</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Replay the same tutorial a second time: the goal is reflex, not memorization.</li>
                <li>Focus on one key feature per attempt (roots, vertex, slope, extrema).</li>
                <li>Use Learn Mode first, then return to Classic/Derivative/Canonical modes to reinforce.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Progression tracking</h2>
            <p>As you complete levels, you unlock radar visualizations that help you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>measure your progress over time</li>
                <li>identify strengths and weaknesses</li>
                <li>target the concepts you want to improve</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your score typically depends on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>precision (how close you are to the drawn solution)</li>
                <li>speed (how long do you take to draw)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can also track your performance through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>global leaderboards</li>
                <li>private leagues with friends or classmates</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data and Account Management</h2>
            <p>Pytha Draw does not collect personal data. You only choose a username (pseudo) used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ranking</li>
                <li>game progression</li>
                <li>league participation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Delete your data</h3>
            <p>You can delete all your data directly from the in-app settings. This permanently removes your:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>username</li>
                <li>scores</li>
                <li>radars</li>
                <li>progression</li>
                <li>league participation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No email request is necessary. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.</p>
